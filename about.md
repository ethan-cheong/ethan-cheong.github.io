I'm a first-year BSc Economics student at the London School of Economics, interested in:

* Machine Learning (Recently been most interested in applications of NLP)
* Tricky Math Problems
* Economics
* Building things
* Language Acquisition
* Constant Learning

Looking for opportunities related to economic research and statistics.

This blog is an archive of my studies, personal projects and other academic-related things I find interesting.
