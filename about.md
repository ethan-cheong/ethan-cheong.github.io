I'm a first-year BSc Economics student at the London School of Economics, interested in:

* Machine Learning (Particularly NLP and Computer Vision, and applying them to Economics Research)
* Math Problems
* Building things - I'm most familiar with python from an OOP standpoint, and am focusing on learning to code more 'pythonically'
* Language Acquisition
* Constant Learning!

Looking for opportunities related to economic research and statistics/data analytics.

This site is an archive of my studies, personal projects and things that intrigue me.
