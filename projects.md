Currently making a cool UI for this page - in the meantime please look at the following posts for examples of projects I've done:

* [Crime Map UK](https://ethan-cheong.github.io/crime-map-uk/) - Dashboards / Building things in python / web apps
* [Love Song Classification](https://ethan-cheong.github.io/love-song-classification-1/) - Data science / Natural Language Processing
