Code for my blog. Forked from hyde (a jekyll theme)

Posts:
1. Taking fast math notes with vim - remaking my templates to look like textbooks
2. Digital Consulting - Price prediction with deep learning
3. Plain ol' consulting - Advising a big company on market entry into the UK
4. ML and Metrics 2 - Predicting Causality


To fix:
1. UI for Projects page
2. Fonts not loading on github pages
3. Mathjax support no longer working
4. Notes page for mooc, courses, books etc.
