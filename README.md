Code for my website.

Posts:
1. Taking fast math notes with vim
2. Macroeconomic/microeconomic modelling
3. Interactively visualizing UK Crime rates with Dash


To fix:
1. Get rid of the description, tab icon, dot
2. Fonts not loading on github pages
3. Mathjax support no longer working
4. Reduce whitespace on right side (center text)
5. GUI for Projects page
6. Notes page for mooc, courses, books etc.
7. Change website color
