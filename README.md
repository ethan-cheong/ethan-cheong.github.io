Code for my website.

Posts:
1. Taking fast math notes with vim
2. Economic modelling
3. Something to do with chemistry? Mapping spectra to molecules paper (Which uses CNNs)


To fix:
1. Fonts not loading on github pages
2. Mathjax support no longer working
3. UI for Projects page
4. Notes page for mooc, courses, books etc.
