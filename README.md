# ethan-cheong.github.io

Made with jekyll, work in progress.

To do:
- Add in sidebar for posts with projects tag that links to each header
- Fix home page, add in list containing notes for course subjects and books you've gone through
- Projects page: make gui similar to Rcharlie's that shows project preview 
- Syntax highlighting - get a dark theme!
- Blog posts - Using plotly with jekyll and github pages, love songs part 2
- Posts on ISLR/Other MOOCs/Next few projects (with LSE socs/personal)
