Code for my blog. Forked from hyde (a jekyll theme)

Posts:
1. Taking fast math notes with vim - remaking my templates
2. Digital Consulting - Price prediction with deep learning
3. Plain ol' consulting - Advising a big company on market entry into the UK


To fix:
1. Fonts not loading on github pages
2. Mathjax support no longer working
3. UI for Projects page
4. Notes page for mooc, courses, books etc.
