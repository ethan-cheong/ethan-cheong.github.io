Code for my website.

Posts:
1. Taking fast math notes with vim
2. Plotly visualizations with github pages
3. Macroeconomic/microeconomic modelling


To fix:
1. Get rid of the description, tab icon, dot
2. Fonts not loading on github pages
3. Center images for blog Posts
4. Reduce whitespace on right side (center text)
5. GUI for Projects page
6. Notes page for mooc, courses, books etc.
